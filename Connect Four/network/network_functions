this is like me talking to myself, pretty much explains my thought process though

(1)Make all your clients connect to the same server (lobby).
(2)Make a room or search for all open rooms 
(3)Once a game is chosen/started, send both clients the info to find the other side: 
	make one of the clients a host for that game, and let the other (selected group of) clients join that host. 
(4)You make sure they all get disconnected from the lobby 
(5) Send the board data back and forth

host makes a move

[3:39] 
draws the board

[3:39] 
sends it to the player

[3:39] 
who draws the same board

[3:39] 
then he makes a move

[3:39] 
send it to the host

[3:39] 
who draws the board

[3:39] 
and sends it back

[3:40] 
while checking for winning and all that nonsense

[3:40]
